          I'm a 17 year old high school student in Atlanta, Georgia who is interested in Computer Science, Jazz Music (and Drumming), and 
          Political Philosophy. When I was 16, I, along with two colleagues, formed a company called Rolltrax, which specializes in 
          automating many of the day-to-day activities of a Work-Based Learning Coordinator. Since then, I have taken the role of Lead 
          Developer alongside my friend <a href="http://ohad.space/">Ohad Rau</a> to develop and maintain Rolltrax. I have also worked as 
          a Network Engineer for the largest school district in Georgia, Fulton County Schools. Outside of my CS career, I enjoy reading 
          and debating political philosophy, and founded the Young Americans for Liberty chapter at my high school. I also am an avid 
          Jazz fan (specifically jazz fusion), and have played drum set since I was seven years old. You can find some of my political
          and musical musings at my <a href="https://medium.com/@zbaylin">Medium blog</a>.

                  This was an app I developed as alongside two friends/developers. 
                  It was designed to be part of the 2018 FBLA Mobile App Development 
                  competition. It's primary job is to serve as a library management
                  tool for both patrons and administrators of a library. The backend
                  is written in <a href="https://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, and the app
                  itself is written in <a href="https://flutter.io">Flutter</a>

                  For my girlfriend Lindsey's birthday, I decided I wanted to make
                  a word clock. The project is based on an Arduino controlling an
                  array of RGB LEDs that can be purchased from eBay. The C code I
                  wrote for the Arduino dynamically generates a sentence that tells
                  the time every five minutes.

                    When I was a junior in high school, I joined my school's Work-Based Learning program 
                    so I could continue my job as a Network Engineer for my school system. Very early on
                    in the school year, the coordinator of the program indicated that he had long wanted
                    a cloud-based attendance system, which would allow him to focus on the more crucial
                    parts of his job. I whipped up a quick prototype in Python using Tk, and Rolltrax was
                    born. It quickly grew into a much more advanced software toolkit, which allows complete
                    management of the administrative tasks of a Work-Based Learning coordinator. Currently,
                    the Rolltrax backend is written in <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>, and
                    the web UI is written in React using the <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/en/">ReasonML</a>
                    OCaml syntax. The mobile app (currently unreleased) is written in <a href="https://flutter.io">Flutter</a>.

                  This was one of my first forays into open-source. I was on a fairly
                  barebones Linux distro with no GUI for changing WiFi networks. I wrote
                  this shell script as an addon to the popular program <a href="https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi">rofi</a>.

                During my time as a Network Engineer at Fulton County Schools, I was tasked
                with creating a kiosk system that allowed students to request repairs for their
                faulty hardware/software. We wrote the kiosk in <a href="https://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>
                and it has been deployed in numerous schools.
